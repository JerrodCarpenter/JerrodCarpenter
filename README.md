### About me
- I love working hard problems and finding elegant solutions. That all starts with being humble enough to work on novel technologies and systems. From automating and connecting infrastructure across the globe to applying responsive design to our web pages, Cerner has given me a breadth of opportunities in many disciplines. What keeps me going is the next challenge. 
- Cerner featured me on their engineering blog, [take a look](https://engineering.cerner.com/blog/cerner-and-icontrol/).
